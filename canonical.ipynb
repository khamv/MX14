    "\n",
    "Most of the methods we consider will assume that we are sampling _with_ replacement.  There are three main reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the applications contemplated, the sample size is a small fraction of the population size, so there is not much difference between sampling with and without replacment.\n",
    "2. The math is far simpler for sampling with replacement.\n",
    "3. In great generality, uncertainties for sampling with replacement are larger than for sampling without replacement (see Hoeffding); hence, these results give a conservative impression of what is possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the approaches do have extensions to sampling without replacement, but the requisite bookkeeping is more complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the methods we will consider draw samples with replacement, but not with equal probabilities. In particular, selecting items with probability proportional to a bound on \"size\" turns out to be very helpful."
